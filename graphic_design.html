The logo on their website currently is incredibly small and hard to see, so in my redesign, I made a higher resolution version of their logo so it can be used at a larger size for their viewers to recognize!</p>

Our theme for the 2022 bash was a carnival and I did my best to make Drexel themed carnival posters, social media posts, and this year we had tote bags made with a similar design. This project was a challenge for me as I had to learn how to work/lead with a team of designers as opposed to doing it myself. This helped me develop cooperation skills that helped me provide good results as a team. </p>
